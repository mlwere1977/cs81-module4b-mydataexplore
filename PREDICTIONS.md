## This is the Forecasts Prior to Coding

**Most Screen Time:** Because I tend to spend more time online during the middle of the week, I anticipate that **Wednesday** will have the highest screen time.
- **Best Focus Day:** I anticipate that **Thursday** will have the highest focus score, probably as a result of less distractions and better sleep.
**Caffeine vs. Focus:** In my opinion, increasing caffeine does not directly enhance focus. In fact, I have a suspicion that excessive caffeine consumption may be linked to poorer concentration.
