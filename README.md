## The Project Overview

This project investigates the analysis of personal data gathered over a week using JavaScript arrays, objects, and functions. 
I was able to create discovery functions that highlight trends and connections in my behavior by monitoring daily routines like sleep, screen time, mood, caffeine consumption, and level of focus.

## The Files Included are:

| File               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `myDataJournal.js` | Main JavaScript file containing weekly data and analysis functions          |
| `PREDICTIONS.md`   | My expectations before running the code                                     |
| `RESULTS.md`       | Actual outputs from the functions and observations                          |
| `REFLECTION.md`    | Personal insights and takeaways from the project                            |

## The Functions Implemented in the Project:

- `calculateAverageSleep()` - calculates the average number of hours of sleep 
- `findDayWithMostScreenTime()` - identifies the day with the most screen time 
- `findMostFrequentMood()` - ascertains the week's most prevalent mood 
- `compareCaffeineToFocus()` - contrasts average levels of focus with and without caffeine

---

## What are the Key Insights:

- **Wednesday** had the most screen time (8 hours)
- **Thursday** was the most focused day (focus score: 9)
- **Less caffeine** correlated with **higher focus**, contrary to expectations
- Each day had a unique mood—no repeats!

---

## What are the Lessons Learned:

- The importance of creating reusable, modular functions; how to use JavaScript to organize and analyze real-world data
- How basic reasoning can uncover significant patterns in routine behavior
- The value of data reflection in enhancing routines and decision-making
