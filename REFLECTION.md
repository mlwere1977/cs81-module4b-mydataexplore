**Name:** Mukwaya Lwere  
**Class:** CS 81 JavaScript  
**Module:** 4B â€“ My Personal Data  
**Date:** July 3, 2025

## What are the Patterns & Surprises:

- The structure of many of the functions was the same: loop through the data, apply a condition, and return a result. 
- Writing and reusing the logic became simpler as a result.
- Every day had a different emotional tone, which surprised me because no mood was the same throughout the week.
- Unexpectedly but enlighteningly, the caffeine-to-focus comparison showed that **less caffeine** actually corresponded with **better focus**.

---

## What are the Logic Challenges?

- It was challenging to design the `mostFrequentMood()` function since I had to count occurrences before figuring out which was the highest.
- Filtering and averaging were necessary to produce a significant correlation between caffeine and focus, which gave me experience working with subsets of data.

---

## What are the Real-World Applications for these Function?

- This type of toolkit could be utilized in **personal productivity tools**, **wellness dashboards**, or **habit tracking apps**.
- It also made it easier for me to understand how **data-driven reflection** can improve decision-making and self-awareness.

## Conculucion:
I was able to relate JavaScript logic to practical patterns thanks to this assignment, which gave the code a more intimate and significant feel.
